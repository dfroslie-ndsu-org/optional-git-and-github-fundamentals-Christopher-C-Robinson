# What I Learned and What Confuses Me

## What I Learned

### Starring and Following

- **Starring**: This feature allows you to bookmark repositories that you find interesting or useful.
- **Following**: This lets you keep track of the activity of users whose work you want to follow.

### Forking vs Cloning

- **Forking**: This is typically used when you want to contribute to someone else's project. It allows you to have your own copy of the project without affecting the original.
- **Cloning**: This is used to create a local copy of a repository so you can work offline. It's more personal and doesn't directly impact the original repository unless you push changes back.

## What Confuses Me

- I'm still a bit confused about when to use a fork versus when to clone.
